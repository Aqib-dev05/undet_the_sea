          <h2>DOLPHIN</h2>
          <p>
            Dolphins are highly intelligent marine mammals belonging to the
            family Delphinidae. They possess a streamlined body ideal for fast
            swimming, and their elongated snout, or beak, gives them a
            distinctive appearance. Their skin is smooth and rubbery, providing
            less resistance in water, while their powerful tails propel them
            through the ocean. Dolphins also have a unique breathing system
            through a blowhole located on top of their heads, allowing them to
            quickly surface for air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dolphins are known for their complex social structures and
            behaviors. They live in groups called pods, which can range from a
            few individuals to over a thousand. These pods work together to
            hunt, protect each other from predators, and care for their young.
            Dolphins communicate using a variety of clicks, whistles, and body
            movements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dolphins are considered one of the most intelligent species on the
            planet. They have large, complex brains relative to their body size,
            which contribute to their advanced cognitive abilities. Dolphins
            exhibit behaviors such as tool use, self-recognition, and even the
            ability to understand complex instructions in captivity.

          <h2>OCTOPUS</h2>
          <p>
            The octopus is a soft-bodied, eight-limbed mollusk belonging to the
            order Octopoda. Its body is highly flexible, allowing it to squeeze
            through incredibly small spaces. The octopus's most notable feature
            is its eight arms, each lined with suction cups that provide both
            incredible grip and sensitivity.One unique aspect of an octopus is
            its ability to change color and texture,which help it camouflage and
            communicate.
          </p>
          <p>
            Octopuses are known for their exceptional intelligence and
            problem-solving abilities. They possess a large brain and a
            sophisticated nervous system, which allows them to learn and exhibit
            behaviors such as using tools, solving puzzles, and navigating
            complex environments. In captivity, octopuses have been observed
            escaping from enclosures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Octopuses are carnivorous and primarily feed on crustaceans,
            mollusks, and small fish. They are ambush predators, often
            camouflaging themselves and waiting for prey to come within striking
            distance. Their powerful beak, located at the center of their arms,
            can dismantle the hard shells of their prey. Some species also
            possess venomous saliva, which helps subdue and digest their prey.

          <h2>SHARK</h2>
          <p>
            Sharks are a diverse group of fish known for their cartilaginous
            skeletons, streamlined bodies, and a keen sense of awareness in the
            water. Unlike bony fish, sharks have a flexible skeleton made of
            cartilage, which makes them lighter and more agile. They possess
            several rows of sharp, replaceable teeth that can be adapted to
            their diet. Sharks also have a unique skin texture made of tiny,
            tooth-like structures called dermal denticles, which reduce drag and
            increase swimming efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sharks are predominantly carnivorous, and their diet varies
            depending on the species.Other species, like the whale shark, are
            filter feeders that consume plankton and small fish by swimming with
            their mouths open to sieve their food from the water. Sharks have
            various hunting strategies; some ambush their prey, while others
            actively chase and herd their target.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sharks inhabit a wide range of marine environments, from shallow
            coastal waters to the deep ocean. They can be found in all of the
            world's oceans, with some species adapted to specific habitats.Some
            species, like the bull shark, are capable of living in both
            saltwater and freshwater environments, often venturing into rivers
            and estuaries.

          <h2>HIPPOPOTAMUS</h2>
          <p>
            The hippopotamus, often referred to as a hippo, is a large,
            semi-aquatic mammal native to sub-Saharan Africa. They are known for
            their massive size, with males weighing up to 3,200 kg (7,000 lbs)
            and females slightly smaller. Hippos have a barrel-shaped body with
            a large head, short legs, and a broad mouth equipped with sharp
            tusks. Their skin secretes a natural sunscreen substance that is red
            and helps protect them from the harsh sun and potential infections.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hippos primarily live in rivers, lakes, and mangrove swamps, where
            they spend most of their time submerged in water to keep their
            massive bodies cool. They are social animals, often found in groups
            called pods, bloats, or herds, usually consisting of around 10-30
            individuals, although larger groups can form in areas with abundant
            resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hippos are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses. They usually
            graze at night, consuming around 40 kg (88 lbs) of grass each night.
            Despite spending most of their time in the water, they do not eat
            aquatic plants. Hippos have a unique way of eating; they use their
            large lips to pull up grass. This diet provides the necessary
            nutrients and energy to sustain their large bodies.
